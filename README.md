# Project 2 - Reci-please!

## Overview:

Reci-please allows for one to create a list of ingredients they have on-hand in order to get a list of recipes back that match their ingredients! The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my progress learning Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, and my overall full-stack development capabilities.
